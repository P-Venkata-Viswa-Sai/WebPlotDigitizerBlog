    "text": "Key Features & Explanation\nWebPlotDigitizer offers a range of features that make it one of the most versatile and user-friendly tools for extracting data from images. Below are some of its key features:\n\nSupport for Multiple Plot Types\nWebPlotDigitizer supports various plot types, including:\n\nXY Plots\n\nBar Charts\n\nPie Charts\n\nPolar Plots\n\nBox Plots\n\nMaps (Raster Images)\n\nThis versatility allows users to extract data from a wide range of graphical sources.\n\n\nManual and Automated Digitization\n\nManual Mode: Click on points manually for precise extraction.\n\nAuto Mode: The tool can automatically detect and digitize points, making the process faster and more efficient for well-defined graphs.\n\n\n\nImage Calibration\nWebPlotDigitizer enables you to calibrate the image by setting the origin and defining the axes, ensuring accuracy when extracting data from non-standard or skewed graphs.\n\n\nData Export\nOnce data is extracted, you can export it in multiple formats, including:\n\nCSV\n\nJSON\n\nExcel\n\nThis makes it easy to integrate the extracted data into further analysis or other applications.\n\n\nPoint Detection and Curve Fitting\nWebPlotDigitizer allows you to detect and fit curves to the data points, making it useful when working with continuous curves in graphs.\n\n\nCode & Libraries involved: Using WebPlotDigitizer Data in Python\nWebPlotDigitizer is not a code-based tool, but it integrates seamlessly with external tools for further analysis. Here’s a simple example of how you might use the digitized data with Python to plot it using Pandas and Matplotlib.\n\nStep 1: Extract Data using WebPlotDigitizer\nAfter digitizing a graph (e.g., extracting data from an XY plot), you can export the data as a CSV file.\n\n\nStep 2: Import and Plot Data in Python\nimport pandas as pd\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n\n# Load the CSV data\ndata = pd.read_csv('your file name.csv')\n\n# Assuming the CSV has columns 'X' and 'Y' for the data points\nplt.plot(data['X'], data['Y'])\nplt.title('Digitized Data from Graph')\nplt.xlabel('X-axis')\nplt.ylabel('Y-axis')\nplt.show()\n\n\n\ntaken y = x² curve for example\n\n\n\n\nChoose the required file from your drive/PC\n___\n\nCalibrate it as shown in the figure\n\n\nSelect two coordinates of x and y and calibrate them\n____\n\n\n\nhighlight the curve to take values using pen and and auto number of points to be chosen on the selected curve.\n\n\n___\n\n\n\nAfter that we get the points as shown and we go into View data option in bottom-left panel.\n\n\n___\n\nThen save the dataset of points in CSV format if you want.\n___\n\n\n\nAs proof, we have chosen the Plotly website and demonstrated the graph using the obtained dataset.\n\n\n___"
