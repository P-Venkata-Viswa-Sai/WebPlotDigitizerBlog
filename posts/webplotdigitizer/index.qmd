## Introduction

When analyzing data, we often encounter graphs in research papers, reports, or images that lack numerical values. Extracting data from these visuals can be a challenge, but **WebPlotDigitizer**, developed by Ankit Rohatgi and hosted at [automeris.io](https://automeris.io/), provides an efficient solution.

This blog covers WebPlotDigitizerâ€™s features, how to use it, and its real-world applications.

## Getting Started with WebPlotDigitizer

### Using the Online Version

-   Open [WebPlotDigitizer](https://automeris.io/WebPlotDigitizer/).
-   Upload an image of a graph.
-   Calibrate the axes and extract data points.

### Installing the Offline Version

If you prefer an offline version: 1. Go to the [WebPlotDigitizer download page](https://automeris.io/WebPlotDigitizer/). 2. Select the appropriate version for your operating system. 3. Extract the downloaded file and run the application.

## Key Features

WebPlotDigitizer offers a variety of features that make data extraction seamless: - **Automatic and Manual Data Extraction**: Works with line graphs, scatter plots, bar charts, and more. - **Supports Different Axis Types**: Linear, logarithmic, polar, and ternary axes. - **Batch Processing**: Extract data from multiple images at once. - **Flexible Export Options**: Save data as CSV, JSON, and other formats.

## Using WebPlotDigitizer with Python

Once you've extracted data, you can analyze it using Python. Below is an example of handling extracted CSV data using Pandas and Matplotlib:

\`\`\`python import pandas as pd import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Load extracted data

file_path = "data.csv" \# Update with your file location data = pd.read_csv(file_path)

# Plot the extracted data

plt.scatter(data\["X"\], data\["Y"\], color='red') plt.xlabel("X-axis") plt.ylabel("Y-axis") plt.title("Extracted Data Plot") plt.show()
